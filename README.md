# SQLite Console Application POC

In this proof of concept (POC), I have developed a streamlined contact application utilizing SQLite as the underlying database. The primary aim of this project is to acquire foundational programming skills in SQL, comprehend effective code structuring in Python, implement comprehensive testing methodologies, employ requirement files for dependency management, and generate relevant diagrams to enhance understanding and documentation.

1. Set the enviroment
    1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine
    1. Install the sqlite3 library, which comes pre-installed with Python
    1. Using the Python sqlite3 library
    1. Create a table named contacts with columns like id, firstname, lastname, email, and phone
&nbsp;     
 1. Create functions for basic operations
    1. Implement functions:
        1. Add a contact
        1. Retrieve a contact
        1. Update a contact 
        1. Delete a contact
    2. Implement a menu-driven uesr interface.
